# 🤖 CV-Zone-Google-Gemini

This project captures visual input from the screen (using a canvas), analyzes it, and sends the relevant information to **Google Gemini** via its API. The response from Gemini is then processed and displayed — providing an interactive and intelligent way to interpret screen-based input.

Additionally, the system can track a person's hand movements, adding a layer of computer vision interaction to the application.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The screen content is captured onto a canvas.
2. Relevant data is extracted and sent to the **Google Gemini API**.
3. Gemini processes the data and returns a response.
4. The response is displayed or used accordingly.
5. Hand tracking is integrated for interactive input.

## 🔐 Requirements
- A valid **Google Gemini API Key**
- Basic understanding of:
  - Computer Vision (OpenCV / MediaPipe)
  - API integration
  - Python (if backend is in Python)

## 🚀 Features
- Canvas-based screen analysis
- Integration with Google Gemini API
- Hand-tracking capability
- Simple and intuitive to understand
- Can be extended for gesture control, virtual assistants, etc.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Google Gemini API
- MediaPipe / OpenCV (for hand tracking)
- JavaScript / Python (depending on your implementation)
- HTML5 Canvas
